## AngularFire API
AngularFire is the officially supported AngularJS binding for Firebase. This binding lets you associate Firebase URLs with Angular models so that they will be transparently and immediately kept in sync with the Firebase servers and with all other clients currently using your app. You can explore more on [api](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/api.html).
